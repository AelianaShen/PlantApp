Avoid direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves. Watering: Allow the top inch or so of the soil to dry out between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's essential to let the soil dry moderately between watering sessions. Temperature: These plants prefer average room temperatures between 65-85째F (18-30째C). They can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures but are sensitive to frost. Humidity: They can adapt to various humidity levels but appreciate occasional misting or placement near a humidifier, especially in dry indoor environments. Fertilizing: Feed your Money Plant with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). Reduce fertilization during the dormant winter months. Potting and Repotting: Repot your Money Plant when it becomes root-bound or outgrows its pot. Spring is an ideal time for repotting. Use a well-draining potting mix. Pruning: Prune to maintain the desired shape and size. Trimming also encourages bushier growth. Propagation: Money Plants are easy to propagate from cuttings. Simply cut a stem with a few nodes and place it in water or soil, and it will develop roots and grow into a new plant."), petToxicity: ["Dogs","Cats"], productiveOrDecorative: "decorative", leafStyle: "dramatic", productColor: "brown", careLevel: "beginner", status: "in_stock", waterLevel: [2], productID: "100001", modelURL: "golden_pothos", lightLevel: [2,3,4], imgURL: "https://osu-software-innovation-plants-2d-img.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/golden_pothos.png", humidityLevel: [2], price: 32, defaultProduct: true, temperatureLevel: [2]),
