# Plants for Urbanites

Plants for Urbanites is a mobile application designed to assist users in purchasing plants that are suitable for their home environment. By leveraging various technologies such as light measurement, augmented reality (AR), and plant data validation, the app aims to provide a seamless experience for urban dwellers looking to incorporate greenery into their living spaces.

## Features

1. **Light Measurement:** The application measures the light in the user's environment to determine the optimal plant species that thrive in similar conditions.

2. **Augmented Reality Plant Sizing:** Users can visualize how different plants will fit in their space by placing a virtual box on the AR screen, which calculates the approximate preferred plant size.

3. **Indoor Arrangement Simulation:** Through AR technology, users can simulate indoor arrangements by placing 3D models of plants in their home environment, helping them visualize the placement before making a purchase.

## Collaboration

This project was developed in collaboration with the OSU Horticulture Department to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the plant data. By partnering with experts in the field, Plants for Urbanites aims to provide users with trustworthy information about the plants they wish to incorporate into their homes.

## HCI Research Integration

Plants for Urbanites builds upon usability research conducted by a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) team project led by the developer during an HCI course. By integrating findings from previous research, the application prioritizes user experience and interface design, making it intuitive and user-friendly.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Serverless Services:** The backend infrastructure of Plants for Urbanites utilizes AWS serverless services, including API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB, ensuring scalability and reliability.

- **ARKit with RealityKit:** The frontend of the application is built on the iOS platform, leveraging ARKit with RealityKit to provide immersive augmented reality experiences for users.
